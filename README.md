# Web-Check-V1
Web-based Apps for pinging other website so that we know the connection status of other website by only inputing their domains
<p>I'm using Codeigniter3 framework for developing thin apps </p>
<p>What to do to run the program:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Extarct the file to your localhost (since i'm using XAMPP i put it on my htdocs folder)</li>
  <li>Import the ping.sql to your database</li>
  <li>you can login using id: tes and password: asd123 or you can make it by your own directly on the database without any encryption to its password</li>
